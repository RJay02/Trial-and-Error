# Clone Task 1: Responsive Basics

## Guidance

Using the target images provided and the specification below, use HTML and CSS to recreate the website for 'Erased Disks', a (fake) music record store for the (real) music label Erased Tapes Records. Your solution must display accurately across a range of screen sizes.

The website is built around the following key breakpoints:

| Viewport width      | Target device | Breakpoint |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| **`360px-539px`**   | Small mobile  |            |
| **`540px-719px`**   | Large mobile  | `540px`    |
| **`720px-1023px`**  | Tablet        | `720px`    |
| **`1024px`** and up | Desktop       | `1024px`   |

Your solution should respond well on all screen widths `360px` and above. However, changes to the design will only occur on the breakpoints listed above.

The images and text you will need are in the [`assets`](assets) folder.

## Specification

1. The colours used should be taken directly from the target images using an appropriate tool.
2. The maximum width of the container should be constrained to `1024px`.
3. The header logo should have a width of `40px` on small mobile, `60px` on large mobile, `80px` on tablet, and `100px` on desktop.
4. Generally, the header logo should use the standard spacing (`24px`). However, on large mobile and tablet, it should use a spacing of `12px`.
5. The footer should use the standard spacing (`24px`).
6. The typography should adhere to the following:

    1. Headings should use the `"Dela Gothic One"` font family. All other text should use the `"Josefin Sans"` font family. Both fonts should both be imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
    2. All text should have a line height of `1.7`.
    3. Paragraphs and headings should have a vertical margin equal to font size of the page. Their horizontal margin should be the standard spacing (`24px`).
    4. On mobile, the font size of headings should be three times the font size of the page. On larger screen sizes, the headings should be four times the font size of the page.

7. On small mobiles, the standard spacing of `24px` should become `8px` throughout the page.
